Mr. O'Connor, who had graduated from Harvard University, started working at General Electric because he wanted to learn about engineering. One of his main projects was trying to find ways to increase efficiency in an effort to reduce overall costs. Along with Mr. F.P. Cox, Mr. O'Connor theorized that if people were doing work that was natural to their abilities, efficiency would increase and employees would be more satisfied and productive.","targetRectangle":{"y":245.4500009417534,"x":150,"width":489.502,"height":121.3999947309494}},{"text":"The early years of industrial testing","targetRectangle":{"y":389.5500041842461,"x":150,"width":249.92,"height":24.79999351501465}},{"text":"Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Cox decided to analyze various jobs to see if they could identify the natural ability each one would need.

From that one test, the Foundation was born.","targetRectangle":{"y":417.5500041842461,"x":150,"width":482.0659999999999,"height":89.3999947309494}},{"text":"JandE.jpg","targetRectangle":{"y":248,"x":659,"width":280.3738474845886,"height":199.9999984502792}},{"text":"Fitting people to the right jobs","targetRectangle":{"y":521.7500042319298,"x":147,"width":217.328,"height":24.79999351501465}},{"text":"As they continued to work on test development and analyses, the point of view of what they were doing was slowly shifting.
